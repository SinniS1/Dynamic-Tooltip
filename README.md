## Dynamic Tooltip

Introducing the "Dynamic Tooltip" Mendix widget, built with React to jazz up your Mendix apps with smarter tooltip
features. This widget goes beyond the basics, offering cool tricks that developers can easily control.

Imagine having tooltips that pop up only when needed â€” like when text overflows its container. With our Dynamic Tooltip,
you can toggle a setting (we call it "Dynamic mode") so that tooltips show up automatically when content gets too long
for its space. No more cluttering the screen with tooltips when everything fits nicely!

Plus, we've added a neat trick to keep things tidy: if text does overflow, we'll snip it with an ellipsis (...). This
means your tooltips will always look slick and won't hog the layout.

## Features

-   Dynamic Visibility: You decide when the tooltip should appear. Turn on Dynamic mode, and it'll only show up when the
    content gets too big for its container.
-   Ellipsis Text: Long text? No problem. We'll trim it with an ellipsis, so your tooltips stay concise and stylish.
-   Easy Setup: It's super easy to use. Just drop the widget into your Mendix project, configure a few settings, and
    voila! Your tooltips are ready to impress.
-   Customizable Goodness: Tweak the settings to fit your app perfectly. Adjust when the tooltip should appear and how
    it should look to match your design.
